# WebApplication1
First ever made RestApi application.This API is for managing restaurant pages, there are roles, and the possibility of creating new restaurants and much more! This code is rewritten from UDEMY course, I did that to remember more from the course, now when I'm writing this readme I feel comfortable in writing Rest Api projects. I also wrote integration tests for this project, but also from a course from Udemy, the biggest problem for me is to understand authorizations and Claims.
#
I Used Automapper, FluentValidation, JwtBearer, StaticFiles, EntityFrameworkCore, NLog and SwashBuckle.
With these packages, I can easily convert one DTO to another, validate things more easily, make tokens that authorize users, connect everything into database, save every single error into logs and make html page with every single Api request that my application has.
